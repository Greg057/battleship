# Battleship Game with Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Project Overview
This project implements the classic game "Battleship" using Test Driven Development (TDD). It focuses on building a robust, testable application, showcasing key concepts in TDD, object-oriented design, and JavaScript module patterns.

## Features
- **Ship Management**: Create ships with attributes like length, hits, and sunk status.
- **Gameboard Functionality**: Place ships, handle attacks, track hits and misses, and check if all ships are sunk.
- **Player Types**: Includes both real and computer players, each with their own gameboard.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players alternate turns to attack the enemy's gameboard.
- **User Interface**: Displays gameboards, allows players to place ships, and interact through event listeners.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core language for game logic and TDD.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for writing and running unit tests.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating and styling the user interface.
